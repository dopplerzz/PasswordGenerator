# PasswordGenerator

Simple to use Password Generator created in Python3 using the Tkinter Library

## Goal
Many users online frequently are accessing and storing private data online with little to no consideration about security. This project solves most of the security concern for weak passwords and will create a new and more secure password using special characters and longer lengths.

## Functionality 

• The user will enter a length between 8 - 32 for password length

• They must also choose atleast 1 of the following character options:
  - Includes lowercase characters (abcde...)
  - Includes uppercase characters (ABCDE...)
  - Inlcudes digits / numbers (12345...)
  - Includes special characters (!@#$%...)

• The user will then click GENERATE which will create a random password that matches the above criteria

• The user can then click COPY to copy the password to their clipboard to be used for their applications
